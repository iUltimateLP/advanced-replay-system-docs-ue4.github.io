# Introduction

A warm welcome to the official documentation for the **Advanced Replay System** available on the Unreal Engine Marketplace, and if you bought it already, thank you very much for your support and interest in the product.   

The **Advanced Replay System** is full-packed with features which make it super easy to integrate a fully working replay system in your game with less work.

Features:   
 - Simple and easy guided setup
 - Self-explaining, greatly documented Blueprint API
 - Less clutter thanks to little amount of Blueprint nodes needed for the system to work as expected
 - Comes with a fully working example project for an integration starting point
 - Rich online documentation
 - Saves Replays to the project's "Saved" folder, which is hidden in the platform's AppData directory in Shipping games

**Note: This plugin requires your project to being fully replicated, even if it is not a multiplayer game! Everything which is not replicated, is not taken into account for replay recording.**

If there is a feature which you're missing, or need for your game, you can always send me an [E-Mail](mailto:iredcraft@gmail.com) or join my [Discord server](http://discord.jverbeek.de).

Thanks for checking this out, greetings from Germany :de: :)
